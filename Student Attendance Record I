class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        absence_count = s.count('A')

        current_count = 0
        max_count = 0

        for char in s:
            if char == 'L':
                current_count = current_count + 1
                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            else:
                current_count = 0
                
        late_count = max_count
        
        if absence_count < 2 and late_count < 3:
            return True
        else:
            return False

(though a much neater solution is given below)

class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return 'LLL' not in s and s.count('A')<2

(attempted the solution, got the concept right but chatgpt solution was much simplier and easier to understand, and below is that solution)

https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/

class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        moves = moves.lower()
        return moves.count('u') == moves.count('d') and moves.count('r') == moves.count('l')

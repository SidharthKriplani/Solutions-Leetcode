(chatgpt's simple solution, mine was running into some test case or the other that was failing, not many, but some)

https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/submissions/1486908581/

class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
            v1_nums = list(map(int, version1.split('.')))
            v2_nums = list(map(int, version2.split('.')))
            
            for num1, num2 in zip_longest(v1_nums, v2_nums, fillvalue=0):
                if num1 < num2:
                    return -1
                elif num1 > num2:
                    return 1
            
            return 0

(acceptable solution for live interviews, but was not passing all the test cases when tried to submit the solution, again asked chatgpt for help, solution given below)

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if len([i for i in s if i not in t]) > 0:
            return [i for i in s if i not in t][0]
        elif len([i for i in t if i not in s]) > 0:
            return [i for i in t if i not in s][0]
        else:
            if set(s)==set(t):
                return list(set(s))[0]

chatgpt's solution (interesting one)

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        result = 0
        for char in s:
            result ^= ord(char)
        for char in t:
            result ^= ord(char)
        return chr(result)

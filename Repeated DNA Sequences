(my solution wasn't working right, chatgpt gave it nicely again, makes sense)

https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/submissions/1486611942/

class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        seen, repeated = set(), set()
        for i in range(len(s) - 9):  
            substring = s[i:i+10]
            if substring in seen:
                repeated.add(substring)
            seen.add(substring)
        return list(repeated)

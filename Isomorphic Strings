(very rudimentary solution, won't work for harder test cases, but I guess working logic is good enough for live interviews)

https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/

class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s = s.lower()
        t = t.lower()

        dic = dict(zip(s, t))

        return len(dic.keys()) == len(set(s)) and len(dic.values()) == len(set(t))

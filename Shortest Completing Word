(half the solution is mine, half from chatgpt, but good problem, althouggh some test cases didn't go through, but that's not the problem for live interviews)

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-completing-word/

class Solution:
    def shortestCompletingWord(self, licensePlate: str, words: List[str]) -> str:
        cnt = 0
        words_dic = {}
        for w in words:
            for x in w:
                if x in licensePlate.lower():
                    cnt+=1
            words_dic[w] = cnt
            cnt = 0

        max_value = max(words_dic.values())
        shortest_word = [word for word in words_dic if words_dic[word]==max_value]

        return min(shortest_word, key = len)
